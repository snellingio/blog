# On Politics

I have been off-the-record when it comes to my political views. I regret not being more honest with friends and family.

If you decide to have a discussion about politics with me, and you are reasonable, I promise to have an honest, nonconfrontational discussion. If we share a common positive outcome for our country, we should be able to reasonably discuss this and figure out how we all keep moving forward. 

I believe ...
- in common sense realities
- in market solutions 
- it is a necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world
- in an active local government
- education is vital to our long-term success
- in respect for public servants - including the police, firefighters, veterans, etc
- in a strong right to privacy
- in helping others financially, socially, and in health - including the poor, the sick, the elderly, veterans, etc
- in a baseline of well-being - such as cancer screenings and treatment, reproductive health, mental health, maternal health, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and any other form of illness - available to be taken advantage of by anyone without declaring bankruptcy
- it is womanâ€™s right to decide whether or not to abort a pregnancy
- in equal rights and protections for all - including women, LGBT, non-white, minorities & immigrants, etc
- we should welcome refugees with open arms
- Freedom of Religion applies to all religions - including those not rooted in Judeo-Christian values
- in scientific research and the consensus of the scientific community
- humans are changing the climate of the world
- renewable energy should be invested in and looked at as a core part of our infrastructure 
- life sentences for nonviolent crimes and the death penalty do not make economic sense
- the internet is a public asset
- automation will take a majority percentage of lower class jobs in the next 20-100 years, and we need to ensure a standard of living when this comes
- self-driving vehicles will save hundreds of thousands of lives around the world, and the government should be actively encouraging research
- Nazi's, Neo-Nazi's, the Alt-Right, or any group actively seeking the persecution of other people over age, race, gender, or religion should be considered terrorists
