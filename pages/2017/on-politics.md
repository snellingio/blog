# On Politics

I have been off-the-record when it comes to my political views. In fact, I've been pretty vocal in the past that individuals should be incredibly _careful_ when talking about politics on the internet, as just about anything on the internet can be used against you in the future. 

With that said, now more than ever in America I believe it is important to have honest, nonconfrontational discussions about moving forward. Not just about here in the next 4 years, but really moving forward in the next two, three, four decades to come.

I regret not being more open and honest with family members and friends. I understand that many are screaming for change in one direction or the other. "Screw politicians!" many are screaming. I'm right there with you. I empathize. But I'm convinced the only path to success is to have a real plan in place. And while I'm not going to be the one to lobby a specific plan, I can be very honest about what I _believe_.

Here's my pledge: if you decide to have a discussion about politics with me, and you are reasonable, I promise to have an honest, nonconfrontational discussion. To be clear, I'm not here to argue over who was a better candidate in the previous election cycle.

For what it's worth, I do not anticipate writing any more on politics. 

I believe:
- I believe in common sense realities
- I believe in market solutions 
- I believe it is a necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world
- I believe that America's debt is real and must be addressed
- I believe in a strong local government
- I believe in respect for public servants. Including police
- I believe in a strong right to privacy. Including from the Government
- I believe in helping others financially, socially, and in health. Including the poor. Including the sick. Including the elderly. Including veterans
- I believe in women's health. I believe in men's health. I believe that there should be a baseline of well being - cancer screenings and treatment, reproductive health, mental health, maternal health, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and any other form of disease or illness - available to be taken advantage of by anyone. I believe that health care should not bankrupt someone
- I believe it is womanâ€™s right to decide whether or not to abort a pregnancy. I also believe that the government should provide funding to adoption agencies
- I believe in equal rights and protections for all. (I can't believe I need to specify) Including women. Including LGBT. Including non-white. Including minorities & immigrants
- I believe that we should welcome refugees with open arms.
- I believe that Freedom of Religion applies to all religions. Not just Judeo-Christian ones
- I believe in education. And while I believe that higher education has serious flaws, I believe America has a duty to become as educated as possible
- I believe in scientific research and the consensus of the scientific community
- I believe that humans are changing the climate of the world. I believe that we must try and protect the earth
- I believe that renewable energy should be invested in and looked at as a core part of our infrastructure 
- I believe that the economics of prison and the death penalty does not make sense
- I believe the internet is a public good that should be protected
- I believe that automation will take a majority percentage of lower class jobs in the next 20-100 years. I believe that we need to ensure a standard of living when this comes
- I believe that self-driving vehicles will save hundreds of thousands of lives around the world, and the government should be actively encouraging research
- I believe Nazi's, Neo-Nazi's, and the Alt-Right should be considered terrorists
- I believe in facts that are true
- Most of all, I believe in being open, honest, and reasonable
