# On Politics

I have been off-the-record when it comes to my political views. In fact, I've been pretty vocal in the past that individuals should be incredibly _careful_ when talking about politics on the internet. 

If you decide to have a discussion about politics with me, and you are reasonable, I promise to have an honest, nonconfrontational discussion. If we share a common positive outcome for our country, we should be able to reasonably discuss this and figure out how we all keep moving forward. 
 
For what it's worth, I do not anticipate writing any more on politics. 

I believe:
- I believe in common sense realities
- I believe in market solutions 
- I believe it is a necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world
- I believe that America's debt is real
- I believe in a strong local government
- I believe in respect for public servants - including the police, firefighters, veterans, etc
- I believe in a strong right to privacy
- I believe in helping others financially, socially, and in health - including the poor, the sick, the elderly, veterans, etc
- I believe that there should be a baseline of well-being - such as cancer screenings and treatment, reproductive health, mental health, maternal health, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and any other form of illness - available to be taken advantage of by anyone without declaring bankruptcy
- I believe it is womanâ€™s right to decide whether or not to abort a pregnancy
- I believe in equal rights and protections for all - including women, LGBT, non-white, minorities & immigrants, etc
- I believe that we should welcome refugees with open arms
- I believe that Freedom of Religion applies to all religions - including non-Judeo-Christian religions
- I believe in education. And while I believe that higher education has serious flaws, I believe America has a duty to become as educated as possible
- I believe in scientific research and the consensus of the scientific community
- I believe that humans are changing the climate of the world. I believe that we must try and protect the earth
- I believe that renewable energy should be invested in and looked at as a core part of our infrastructure 
- I believe that the economics of prison and the death penalty does not make sense
- I believe the internet is a public asset that needs to be preserved
- I believe that automation will take a majority percentage of lower class jobs in the next 20-100 years, and we need to ensure a standard of living when this comes
- I believe that self-driving vehicles will save hundreds of thousands of lives around the world, and the government should be actively encouraging research
- I believe Nazi's, Neo-Nazi's, the Alt-Right, or any group actively seeking the persecution of other people over age, race, gender, religion, etc should be considered terrorists
