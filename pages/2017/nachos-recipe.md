<br>

## 1. Place into a small pot on medium-low:
* 16 oz - Refried beans (1 x 16 oz can)
* 1/3 cup - Mild salsa or sauce
* 1/4 tsp - Chipotle chile powder
* 1/4 tsp - Kosher salt

<small>Note: Any mild salsa / sauce works. Taco Bell mild / hot is good.</small>

Stir until well mixed. You can bump up the heat if you think the beans are "watery."

<br>

## 2. Line a pan with foil, place scoop chips face up.

<small>Note: The "scoop chips" are the secret here. [Tostito Oven Baked Scoops](http://www.fritolay.com/snacks/product-page/oven-baked/tostitos-oven-baked-scoops-tortilla-chips), or [Tostito Multigrain Scoops](http://www.fritolay.com/snacks/product-page/tostitos/tostitos-multigrain-scoops-tortilla-chips) are both great.</small>

## 4. Grind 8-12 oz of Colby & Monterey Jack cheese, sprinkle over scoop chips.

<small>Is grinding the cheese worth it over the big bags of mixed cheese? Yes.</small>
