I've been eating these nachos once every week or two for years.

## 1. Place into a small pot on medium-low:
* 16 oz - Refried beans (1 x 16 oz can)
* 1/3 cup - Mild salsa or sauce
* 1/4 tsp - Chipotle chile powder
* 1/4 tsp - Kosher salt

Stir until well mixed. You can bump up the heat if you think the beans are "watery."

## 2. Line a pan with foil, place scoop chips face up.
