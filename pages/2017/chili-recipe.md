## Place into the slow cooker, turn on low:
* 28 oz - Crushed tomatoes (1 x 28oz can)
* 32 oz  - Black chili beans (2 x 16oz cans)
* 12 oz - Mild salsa, pick your favorite
* 16 oz - Beef broth
* 1 oz - Dark chocolate
* 1 tbsp - Chili powder
* 1 tbsp - Oregano
* 1 tsp - Cumin, ground
* 1 tsp  - Garlic, crushed
* 1 tsp - Pepper, ground
* 1 tsp - Sugar, granulated
* 1 tsp - Brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp - Ancho chile powder
* 1/4 tsp - Chipotle chile powder
* 1/4 tsp - Cayenne pepper powder
* 1 - Bay leaf

## Brown, drain, and place into the slow cooker:
* 24 oz - Ground beef

## Cook, place into the slow cooker:
* 16 oz - Tenderloin chunks, cooked to medium rare
* 8oz - Chicken breast, shredded, cooked fully (optional)

<small>Note: Make sure the tenderloin gets a minimum of 7 hours in the slow cooker. Will turn into a pot roast texture.</small>

## In the last hour or two, place into the slow cooker:
* 8 oz - Tortilla chips, crushed
* 1 1/2 tsp - Chipotle Tabasco sauce (to taste)

<strong>Total time: ~10hrs.</strong>

Serve with freshly grated Colby, and Monterey Jack cheeses. We like ours over steamed white rice.

<small>Note: The key to steamed white rice is [washing the rice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1TmEXi1v6Q) before cooking.</small>

In the future, I'll be exploring these ingredients further:
* Pork
* Bison
* Lamb
* Kidney beans
* Adobo sauce
* Whole chipotle peppers
* Medium ale (beer)
