# Beer, 2017

Personal goal to taste ~~50~~ 100 different beers in 2017. I have highlighted in <span class="green">green</span> ones that are exceptionally good, and highlighted in <span class="red">red</span> ones that I did not care for at all.
I have included links, where applicable, to [Rate Beer](https://www.ratebeer.com/) where you can learn more about each.

<strong>Current status: 18/100</strong>, as of <i>January 22nd</i>
